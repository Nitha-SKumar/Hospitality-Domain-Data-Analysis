## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands operates numerous top-tier hotels throughout India, boasting a two-decade presence in the hospitality sector. Despite their longstanding reputation, recent challenges stemming from competitive maneuvers and managerial inefficiencies have led to declining market presence and revenue within the luxury and business hotel segment. Recognizing the need for a strategic overhaul, the managing director of AtliQ Grands aims to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence" practices to reclaim their lost market share and revenue. However, the company currently lacks an internal team proficient in data analytics to furnish them with the necessary insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Task:  

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

- Create the metrics according to the metric list.
- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
